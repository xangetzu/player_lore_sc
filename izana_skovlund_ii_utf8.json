  "backstory": "Born into a lineage long steeped in mysticism, astronomy, and coded history, Izana Skovlund II is a direct descendant of the original founder of Wayfinder. Though much of her youth remains classified within the organization’s archives, it is known that she was initiated into Wayfinder's higher rites before adulthood. She emerged during a time of great upheaval in the outer systems, stepping forward not as a warrior, but as a pathmaker—one who could see beyond immediate crises to long-term destiny.\n\nAssuming the title of Oracular, she restructured Wayfinder as both a sanctuary and a compass. Though firmly committed to nonpartisan exploration, she is no pacifist. Izana has led her people through threats both known and veiled, and her actions in unknown systems have been whispered about by independent explorers and UEE field agents alike. Many believe she is more than a leader—perhaps a seer whose dreams are not dreams at all, but coordinates in waiting.",
