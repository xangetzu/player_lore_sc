The crew crossed the Stanton system, ultimately linking up between MicroTech and Calliope.

    "long_summary": "The Durendal departed August Dunlow in the early local hours, its cargo holds freshly restocked, and its systems tuned for the long jump across Stanton. Our objective was simple: a system-spanning rendezvous with old allies and new companions.\n\nWith coordinates locked, we made the burn from Crusader and leapt across the void, crossing through quantum space in silence. The journey was uneventful\u2014a rarity, and a quiet blessing.\n\nArrival near MicroTech revealed the familiar glint of The Nathanial Green, anchored between the planet and its icy moon Calliope. We took up formation, orbital stabilizers humming as we held position.\n\nElflaco and Guardian joined the party, skillfully landing their Avenger Titan and F7A-Mk II Hornet aboard the Idris. After brief comms confirmation, I, Izana Skovlund II, initiated EVA transfer to the Green, where new plans were already brewing. The Durendal remained behind as a sentinel, her silhouette quiet and poised against the stars.",
