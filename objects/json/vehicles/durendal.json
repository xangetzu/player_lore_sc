    "long_history": "The Durendal was acquired shortly after the ascension of Izana Skovlund II to leadership of Wayfinder. Intended as a mobile base of operations, the ship has been gradually tuned for long-range expeditions, deep scanning operations, and self-sustained traversal of uncharted space. While it remains faithful to Anvil's design philosophy, key components have been upgraded to support prolonged independent journeys and field analysis. The ship’s history includes voyages beyond surveyed space, aiding in the recovery of lost data archives and the rediscovery of dormant celestial anomalies. It serves as both flagship and relic — a vessel whose decks have echoed with centuries of echoes, dreams, and data. The wear it bears is not from neglect but from purpose: every carbon scoring, every hull plate microfracture is a record of perseverance.",
